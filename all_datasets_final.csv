75^Twelve New Microsatellite Markers of Fejervarya Keralensis^Fejervarya keralensis is a poorly studied frog species endemic to Western Ghats biodiversity hot spot, India. This data describe primers and polymerase chain reactions for 12 microsatellite loci for F. keralensis. Ten of the primers were polymorphic on sample of 23 individuals from a single sampling site (Schenduruni Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala) with an average 5.5 alleles per locus (range = 2-13). The average observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.65 and 0.57 respectively. The loci should be useful in conservation genetic studies of Fejervarya frogs. Remya Raveendran, Sujith V.
